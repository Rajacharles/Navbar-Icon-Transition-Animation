The menu button is an element inside the Navbar that organizes the nav links when there is limited horizontal space, like on a mobile device.
The menu button and its functionality are built into the Navbar element, and can be accessed and configured in a number of ways. We’ll cover four aspects of the menu button:

2. Device visibility
3. Menu animations
4. Styling the menu button
